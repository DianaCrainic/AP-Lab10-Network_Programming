# Network Programming

- Compulsory: all tasks done
- Optional: first task done

The game's functionalities are implemented (classes: Game, Board, Player) and I created the GUI for the game using java Swing. 
I am working on the next tasks including the commands (such as submit move), game management and mediating the players.
